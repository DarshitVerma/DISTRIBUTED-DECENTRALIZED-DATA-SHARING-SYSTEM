## Features

- Peer-to-peer file upload, retrieval, and configurable replication
- Dynamic routing table with gossip-based metadata propagation
- Node liveness detection via health pings and auto-removal
- REST API-based communication between nodes
- Multi-threaded gossip and health-check operations
- Simple UI for uploading, registering peers, requesting files

## Technologies

- Python, Flask
- REST APIs
- Multi-threading
- Gossip Protocol
