# DISTRIBUTED-DECENTRALIZED-DATA-SHARING-SYSTEM
Built a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing system where each node functions as both client and server, eliminating the need for central coordination. The system uses dynamic routing tables and a custom gossip protocol for decentralized peer discovery and metadata sharing. It supports file upload, retrieval, and replication (with a configurable replication factor) using RESTful APIs. Fault tolerance is achieved through periodic node liveness checks using health pings and automatic removal of unreachable nodes. Files are replicated across random peer nodes to ensure availability and resilience. Multi-threading is used to handle background tasks like gossiping and health monitoring without blocking core operations. Additionally, simple UI templates were created for uploading files, registering peers, requesting files, and viewing the routing table. This project strengthened my understanding of decentralized coordination, eventual consistency, and fault-tolerant distributed system design.
